                <p class="blog-description">
                    <p>The first year at IIT Gandhinagar is packed with excitement and learning. I’ve had the chance to work on diverse projects like creating a Formula 1 car design and organizing events for TEDxIITGandhinagar. Each activity has challenged me to push my boundaries.</p>
                </p>

                <p class=" blog-description">
                    Academically, I’ve been exploring various subjects, including engineering graphics and writing courses, where I’ve honed my storytelling and technical skills. Outside the classroom, being part of the TEDx curation team has taught me the value of teamwork and creativity.

                <p class=" blog-description">
                    Looking ahead, I aspire to make the most of my time at IIT Gandhinagar by delving deeper into machine learning, artificial intelligence, and innovation. I also aim to contribute to the institute’s vibrant community and inspire others through my journey
